Input file terminology
=========================
Vehicle general characteristics
-------------------------------
.. glossary::
    ``input_version``
        It corresponds to the version of the template file used for |co2mpas| -
        not to the |co2mpas| version of the code.
        Different versions of the file have been used throughout the development of the tool.
        Input files from version >= 2.2.5 can be used for type approving.

    ``vehicle_family_id``
        It corresponds to an individual code for each vehicle that is simulated with the |co2mpas| model.
        This ID does not affect the NEDC prediction.
        The ID is allocated in the `output report` and in the `dice report`.
        This is the structure of the ID::

            FT-TA-WMI-yyyy-nnnn

        Where:

        - ``FT`` is the identifier of the family type according to this:

          - ``'IP'``: Interpolation family as defined in paragraph 5.6.
          - ``'RL'``: Road load family as defined in paragraph 5.7.

          - ``'PR'``: Periodically regenerating systems (Ki) family as defined in paragraph 5.9.

        - ``TA`` is the distinguishing number of the EC Member State authority responsible for the family approval
          as defined in [section 1 of point 1 of Annex VII of Directive (EC) 2007/46](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32007L0046&from=EN).
          1 for Germany; 2 for France; 3 for Italy; 4 for the Netherlands; 5 for Sweden; 6 for Belgium; 7 for Hungary;
          8 for the Czech Republic; 9 for Spain; 11 for the United Kingdom; 12 for Austria; 13 for Luxembourg; 17 for Finland;
          18 for Denmark; 19 for Romania; 20 for Poland; 21 for Portugal; 23 for Greece; 24 for Ireland; 26 for Slovenia;
          27 for Slovakia; 29 for Estonia; 32 for Latvia; 34 for Bulgaria; 36 for Lithuania; 49 for Cyprus; 50 for Malta.
        - ``WMI`` (world manufacturer identifier) is a code that identifies the manufacturer
          in a unique manner and is defined in ISO 3780:2009.
          For a single manufacturers several WMI codes may be used.
        - ``yyyy`` is the year when the test for the family were concluded.
        - ``nnnn`` is a four digit sequence number.

    ``fuel_type``
        Used to indicate the type of fuel used by the vehicle during the test.
        The user must select one among the following options:
        - diesel,
        - gasoline,
        - LPG,
        - NG or biomethane,
        - ethanol(E85) or
        - biodiesel.

    ``engine fuel lower heating value``
        Lower heating value of the fuel used in the test, expressed in [kJ/kg] of fuel.

    ``fuel_carbon_content_percentage``
        The amount of carbon present in the fuel by weight, expressed in [%].

    positive ignition

        Provide the fuel consumption of the vehicle in warm conditions during idling. The idling fuel consumption
        of the vehicle, expressed in grams of fuel per second [gFuel/sec] should be measured when:
        * velocity of the vehicle is 0
        * the start-stop system is disengaged
        * the battery state of charge is at balance conditions.
        For |co2mpas| purposes, the engine idle fuel consumption can be measured as follows: just after a WLTP physical test,
        when the engine is still warm, leave the car to idle for 3 minutes so that it stabilizes. Then make a constant
        measurement of fuel consumption for 2 minutes. Disregard the first minute, then calculate idle fuel consumption as the
        average fuel consumption of the vehicle during the subsequent 1 minute.

    ``final_drive_ratio``
        Provide the ratio to be multiplied with all `gear_box_ratios`. If the car has more than 1 final drive ratio (eg,
        vehicles with dual/variable clutch), leave blank the final_drive_ratio cell in the Inputs tab and provide the
        appropriate final drive ratio for each gear in the gear_box_ratios tab.

    ``tyre_code``
        Tyre code of the tyres used in the WLTP test (e.g., P195/55R16 85H\).
        |co2mpas| does not require the full tyre code to work.
        But at least provide the following information:
        - nominal width of the tyre, in [mm];
        - ratio of height to width [%]; and
        - the load index (e.g., 195/55R16\).
        In case that the front and rear wheels are equipped with tyres of different radius (tyres of different width do not
        affect |co2mpas|), then the size of the tyres fitted in the powered axle should be declared as input to |co2mpas|.
        For vehicles with different front and rear wheels tyres tested in 4x4 mode, then the size of the tyres from the wheels
        where the OBD/CAN vehicle speed signal is measured should be declared as input to |co2mpas|.

        Initial temperature of the test cell during the WLTP-L test. It is used to calibrate the thermal model.
        The default value is 23 °C.

    ``alternator_efficiency``
        Average alternator efficiency as declared by the manufacturer; if the value is not provided,
        the default value is = 0.67.

    ``gear_box_ratios``
        Insert in the ``gear_box_ratios`` tab of the input file the gear box ratios as an array
        ``[ratio gear 1, ratio gear 2, ...]``

    ``full_load_speeds``
        Insert in the ``T1_map`` tab of the input file the engine full load speeds. Input the engine speed [rpm] array used by
        the OEM to calculate the gearshifting in WLTP. The engine maximum speed, and the engine speed at maximum power are

Vehicle technologies
--------------------
The |co2mpas| model calculates the NEDC |CO2| emission prediction considering the presence/absence
of a set of technologies in the vehicle.
For the following |co2mpas| inputs, 0 corresponds to the absence of the technology
whereas 1 is when the vehicle is equipped with the technology.
If no input is provided, the |co2mpas| model will use the default value.

.. glossary::

    turbo
    ``engine_is_turbo``
        If the air intake of the engine is equipped with any kind of forced induction system
        set like a turbocharger or supercharger, then set it to 1; otherwise set it to 0.
        The default value is 1.

    S-S
    ``has_start_stop``
        The start-stop system shuts down the engine of the vehicle during idling to reduce fuel consumption and
        it restarts it again when the footbrake/clutch is pressed.
        If the vehicle has a *S-S* system, set it to 1, otherwise, set it to 0.
        The default is 1.

    ``has_energy_recuperation``
        Set it to 1 if the vehicle is equipped with any kind of brake energy recuperation technology or
        regenerative breaking. Otherwise, set it to 0.
        The default is 1.

    torque converter
    ``has_torque_converter``
        Set it to 1 if the vehicle is equipped with this technology otherwise,
        set it to 0.
        For manual transmission vehicles the default is 0.
        For automatic tranmission vehicles, the default is 1.
        For vehicles with continuously variable transmission, the default is 0.

    ``fuel_saving_at_strategy``
    eco mode
        Setting it to 1 allows |co2mpas| to use a higher gear at constant speed driving
        than when in transient conditions, resulting in a reduction of fuel consumption.
        This technology was refered as ``eco_mode`` in previous releases of |co2mpas|.
        The default is 1.

    ``has_periodically_regenerating_systems``
        If the vehicle is equipped with periodically regenerating systems
        (anti-pollution devices such as catalytic converter or particulate trap)
        that require a periodical regeneration process in less than 4000 km of normal vehicle operation,
        set it to 1; otherwise, set it to 0.
        The default is 0.

    ``ki_factor``
        For vehicles without `has_periodically_regenerating_systems` ``ki_factor`` is set to 1.
        For vehicles with periodically regenerating systems, if not provided,
        this value is set to 1.05. The ``ki_factor`` to be used for |co2mpas| is the same value used for NEDC physical tests.

    VVA
    Variable Valve Actuation
    ``engine_has_variable_valve_actuation``
        This includes a range of technologies which are used to enable variable valve event timing,
        duration and/or lift. The term as set includes Valve Timing Control (VTC)—also referred to
        as Variable Valve Timing (VVT) systems and Variable Valve Lift (VVL) or
        a combination of these systems (phasing, timing and lift variation).
        Set it to 1 if the vehicle is equipped with such a system; otherwise, set it to 0.
        The default is 0.

    ``engine_has_cylinder_deactivation``
        This technology allows the deactivation of one or more cylinders under specific conditions predefined
        in the |co2mpas| code. The implementation in |co2mpas| allows to use different deactivation ratios.
        So in the case of an 8-cylinder engine, a 50% deactivation (4 cylinders off) or
        a 25% deactivation ratio (2 cylinders off) are plausible. |co2mpas| selects the optimal ratio at each point
        from the plausible deactivation ratios provided by the user. The user cannot alter the deactivation strategy.
        If the vehicle is equipped with a cylinder deactivation system, set it to 1 and
        and indicate the deactivation ratios in the `active_cylinder_ratios` tab.
        Note that the `active_cylinder_ratios` always start with 1 (all cylinders are active) and then
        the user can set the corresponding ratios.

        For example, if the vehicle has an engine with 6 cylinders and it has the possibility
        to deactivate 2 or 3 or 4 cylinders, you have to introduce the following ratios:
        0.66 (4/6), 0.5 (3/6), and 0.33 (2/6).
        If the vehicle does not have cylinder deactivation set `engine_has_cylinder_deactivation` to 0.
        The default is 0.

        Note that **as of November 2016 this specific technology is in validation phase** due to
        lack of sufficient data to support its appropriate implementation in the code.
        For **Rally** release, this specific input is considered to be optional.

    lean burn
    LB
    ``has_lean_burn``
        The lean burn (LB) technology refers to the burning of fuel with an excess of air in an
        internal combustion engine. All `compression ignition` vehicles are supposed to be equipped with *LB*
        by default therefore for `compression ignition` this must be set to 0.
        For `positive ignition` engines set it to 1 if the vehicle is equipped with *LB*,
        otherwise set it to 0.
        The default is 0.

    ``has_gear_box_thermal_management``
        This specific technology option applies only to vehicles in which the temperature of the gearbox
        is regulated from the vehicle's cooling circuit using a heat-exchanger, heating storage system or
        other methods for directing engine waste-heat to the gearbox.
        Gearbox mounting and other passive systems (encapsulation) should not be considered.
        In case the vehicle is equipped with the described gear box thermal management system,
        set it to 1; otherwise, set it to 0.
        The default is 0.

        Note that **as of November 2016 this specific technology is in validation phase** due to
        lack of sufficient data to support its appropriate implementation in the code.
        For **Rally** release, this specific input is considered to be optional.


    EGR
    Exhaust gas recirculation
    ``has_exhausted_gas_recirculation``
         EGR recirculates a portion of an engine's exhaust gas back to the engine cylinders
         to reduce |NOx| emissions. The technology does not concern internal (in-cylinder) EGR.
         Set it to 1 if the vehicle is equipped with external EGR
         (high-pressure, low-pressure, or a combination of the two); otherwise, set it to 0.
         The default is 0 for `positive ignition`, and 1 for `compression ignition` engines.

    SCR
    ``has_selective_catalytic_reduction``
        On `compression ignition` vehicles, the Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system uses urea
        to reduce |NOx|  emissions.
        Therefore this technology is only applicable for `compression ignition` engines.
        If the vehicle is equipped with SCR set `has_selective_catalytic_reduction` to 1; otherwise, set it to 0.
        The default value is 0.

        Note that **as of November 2016 this specific technology is in validation phase** due to
        lack of sufficient data to support its appropriate implementation in the code.
        For **Rally** release, this specific input is considered to be optional.


Dyno configuration
------------------
.. glossary::
    ``n_dyno_axes.WLTP-H``
        The WLTP regulation states that WLTP tests should be performed using a dyno with 2 rotating axis.
        Therefore, the default value for this variable is 2.
        Setit to 1 in case a 1 rotating axis dyno was used during the WLTP-H test.

    ``n_dyno_axes.WLTP-L``
        The WLTP regulation states that WLTP tests should be performed using a dyno with 2 rotating axis.
        Therefore, the default value for this variable is 2.
        Set it to 1 in case a 1 rotating axis dyno was used during the WLTP-L test.


DICE
====
.. glossary::
    dice report sheet
        A sheet in the output file containing non-confidential results of the simulation to be communicated
        to supervision bodies through a `timestamp server`.
    dice report
        Contains the information from the dice report sheet and the PGP signature, signed with the
        electronic key of the user.
    stamp response
        The response from the Timestamp Server.
    decision report
        In CO2MPAS versions v1.7.x or later, the `co2dice project trecv/tparse` commands generate 
        another type of report, the `decision-report`, that is also signed with your secret-key, 
        and which contains ``HASH-2`` at the top.
    dice email
    dice request email
        The actual email sent to be timestamped (roughly derived from Input + output files)::

        := dice Report + HASH #1

    dice stamp
    dice response email
        The timestamped `dice email` as received from the `timestamp server`,
        from which the OK/SAMPLE decision-flag is derived:

        := dice email + timestamp + Signature (random)

    decision flag
    dice decision flag
        The ``'OK'``/``'SAMPLE'`` flag derived from the `dice stamp`'s signature - it is an abstract entity,
        not stored anywhere per se, but it combined with other data to ensure an unequivocal link with them.
        The meaning of the flag's valuesd is the following:

        - ``'SAMPLE'`` means that indipendently of the result of |co2mpas| prediction
          the vehicle has to undergo an NEDC physical test;
        - ``'OK'`` means that the declared NEDC value is accepted
          (assuming |co2mpas| prediction does not deviate more than 4% of the declared NEDC value).

    .. image:: _static/dice_co2mpas_dev.PNG

    dice decision
        A new file that is stored in the TAA files which contains the `dice stamp` and
        the derived `decision flag`::

    output report
    output report sheet
        A sheet in the output file that contains they key results of the simulation.

    TAA Report
        A "printed" PDF file sent to TAA to generate the Certificate which is
        unequivocally associated with all files & reports above::

        := output Report + dice decision + Hash #2

    timestamp server
        The email service that appends a cryptographic signature on all its incoming e-mails,
        certifying thus the existence in time of those emails.  The trust on its certifications
        stems from the list of signatures published daily in its site.

        that can be generated cryptographically from any kind of `e-file` based
        exclusively on its contents; even if a single bit of the file changes,
        its hash-id is guaranteed to be totally different.

    dice
    dice command
    dice application,
    sampling application,
        The |co2mpas| application responsible for producing a sampling flag that defines
        whether a Vehicle has to undergo a physical testing under NEDC (in addition to WLTP).

    Git
        An open-source version control system use for software development that
        organizes files in versioned folders, stored based on their `hash`.
        It is distributed, in the sense that any Git installation can communicate and exchange
        files and versioned folders with any other installation.

    SHA1
        A fast and secure hashing algorithm with 160bit numbers (20 bytes, 40 hex digits),
        used by `Git`.

        Example::

               SHA1(“Hi CO2MPAS”) = 911907f21baea8215a38a10396403bd7cd81bddf

    Git DB
    Hash DB
    Git repo
    Git repo DB
        The git repository maintained by the `dice` command that collects all the files and reports
        generated during the Type Approving process with |co2mpas|.
        It is created by the Technical Service and must be sent to the Type Approval Authority.
        Any `hash` generated in the mean time are retrieved by this repository.


    IO
        Input/Output; when referring to a software application, we mean the internal interfaces
        that read and write files and streams of data from devices, databases or other external resources.

    OEM
        Original Equipment Manufacturers, eg. a Vehicle manufacturer

    Capped cycles
        For vehicles that cannot follow the standard NEDC/WLTP cycles (for example, because they have not enough power to attain the acceleration and maximum speed values required in the operating cycle) it is still possible to use the |co2mpas| tool to predict the NEDC |co2| emission. For these capped cycles, the vehicle has to be operated with the accelerator control fully depressed until they once again reach the required operating curve. Thus, the operated cycle may last more than the standard duration seconds and the subphases may vary in duration. Therefore there is a need to indicate the exact duration of each subphase. This can be done by filling in, the corresponding bag_phases vector in the input file which define the phases integration time [1,1,1,...,2,2,2,...,3,3,3,...,4,4,4]. Providing this input for WLTP cycles together with the other standard vectorial inputs such as speed,engine speed, etc. allows |co2mpas| to process a "modified" WLTP and get calibrated properly. The NEDC that is predicted corresponds to the respective NEDC velocity profile and gearshifting that applies to the capped cycle, which is provided in the appropriate tab. Note that, providing NEDC velocity and gear shifting profile is not allowed for normal vehicles.

    Rotational mass
        The rotational mass is defined in the WLTP GTR (ECE/TRANS/WP.29/GRPE/2016/3) as the equivalent effective mass of all
        the  wheels and vehicle components rotating with the wheels on the road while the gearbox is placed in neutral, in kg. It shall
        be measured or calculated using an appropriate technique agreed upon by the responsible authority. Alternatively, it may be
        estimated to be 3 per cent of the sum of the mass in running order and 25 kg.
