|co2mpas| is backward-looking longitudinal-dynamics |CO2| and
fuel-consumption simulator for light-duty M1 & N1 vehicles (cars and vans), specially crafted to
*estimate and type-approve CO2 emissions* of vehicles undergoing NEDC testing
based on the emissions produced during WLTP tests, according to the *EU legislation*
(see `History`_ section, below).

It is an open-source project(`EUPL 1.1+ <https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/software/page/eupl>`_)
developed for Python-3.5+ using |winpython|_ & |anaconda|_ under Windows 7,
Anaconda under MacOS, and standard python environment under Linux.
It runs either as a *console command* or as a *desktop GUI application*,
and it uses Excel-files or pure python structures (dictionary and lists) for its
input & output data.


Quick Start
===========
You may find usage Guidelines in the wiki:
https://github.com/JRCSTU/CO2MPAS-TA/wiki/CO2MPAS-user-guidelines

IF you are familiar with Python, AND
IF you already have a full-blown *python-3 environment*
(i.e. *Linux* or the *all-in-one* archive), AND
IF you have familiarity with previous releases, THEN
you can immediately start working with the following *bash* commands;
otherwise follow the detailed instructions under sections :ref:`install` and
:ref:`usage`.

.. code-block:: console

    ## Install co2mpas:
    $ pip uninstall co2mpas
    $ pip install co2mpas

    ## Create a template excel-file for inputs:
    $ co2mpas template vehicle_1.xlsx

    ###################################################
    ## Edit generated `./input/vehicle_1.xlsx` file. ##
    ###################################################

    ## Launch GUI, select the edited template as Input, and click `Run`:
    $ co2gui

And the GUI pops up:

   :width: 640

Further command-line alternatives:

.. code-block:: console


    ## To synchronize the Dyno and OBD data with the theoretical:
    $ datasync template --cycle wltp.class3b template.xlsx
    $ datasync -O ./output times velocities template.xlsx#ref! dyno obd -i alternator_currents=integral -i battery_currents=integral

    ## Run batch simulator.
    $ co2mpas batch vehicle_1.xlsx -O output -f

    ###################################################
    ## Inspect generated results inside `./output/`. ##
    ###################################################

    ## Run type approval command.
    $ co2mpas ta vehicle_1.xlsx -O output -f

    ## Start using the DICE command-line tool:
    $ co2dice --help


History
=======
The *European Commission* has introduced the *WLTP* as test procedure for the type I test
of the European type-approval of Light-duty vehicles as of September 2017.
Its introduction has required the adaptation of |CO2| certification and monitoring procedures
set by European regulations (443/2009 and 510/2011).
European Commission’s *Joint Research Centre* (JRC) has been assigned the development
of this vehicle simulator to facilitate this adaptation.

The European Regulation setting the conditions for using |co2mpas| can be
found in `the Comitology Register
<http://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regcomitology/index.cfm?do=search.documentdetail&dos_id=0&ds_id=45835&version=2>`_
after its adoption by the *Climate Change Committee* which took place on
June 23, 2016 and its 2nd vote for modifications, on April 27, 2017.

For recent activity, check the :doc:`changes`.


Licensing
=========
The |co2mpas| application, both executable and its sources, is distributed under the EUPL license.
EUPL is `"eventually" compatible
<https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/community/eupl/og_page/eupl-compatible-open-source-licences>`_
with all major open-source licenses, whether copy-lefted or not, but in reality
|co2mpas| does not contain any prior code to derive from - all the code is a property of JRC's
and covered by the said license.


The *ALLINONE archive* contains many python libraries installed in its standard python -folder,
(``co2mpas_ALLINONE-XXX\Apps\WinPython\python-YYY.amd64\Lib\``)
so |co2mpas| only `"links dynamically"
<https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/community/eupl/og_page/eupl-compatible-open-source-licences#section-3>`_ to them.
A non-exhaustive list of python-libraries contained is listed in `WinPython site
<https://github.com/winpython/winpython/blob/master/changelogs/WinPython-3.5.2.1.md>`_
plus those manually installed by JRC when installing |co2mpas| in ALLINONE.
We are certain that all of them are open-source and can be freely re-distributed.

The ALLINONE contains also *"external programs"*, all of them open-source,
except from the MS redistributable (``Apps/vc_redist.x64.exe`` file)
which is explicitly exempted from the usual `restrictive MS Licenses
<https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms235299.aspx>`_.


All the *logo and graphic work* is our own, but without having registered for trademark;
we are discouraged by the EU guidelines on the subject; subsequently we discourage
their use without our consent, beyond their intended usage, which is to run |co2mpas|.

Install
=======
On *Windows* you may install the latest *all-In-One* archive and ensure it
contains (or *upgrade* to) the latest |co2mpas| python package; alternatively,
you may install the developer version.

   .. Tip::
      Installing and using ALLINONE is the official procedure for
      running |co2mpas| for Type Approval (TA).

.. _all-in-one:

Requirements
--------------
- These are the  minimum IT requirements for the Computer to run CO2MPAS & DICE:
- 64-bit Intel or AMD processor (x86_64, aka x64, aka AMD64);
- Microsoft Windows 7, or later;
- 4 GB RAM (more recommended);
- 2.4 GB hard disk storage for extracting the software, more space for the input/output files;
- Execution-rights to the installation folder (but no Admin-rights).
- An e-mail account to send & receive DICE e-mails;
- Unhindered SMTP access to this email-server (no firewall on ports 25, 465, 587);
  or access through SOCKS Proxy (see diagram below);

  .. image:: doc/_static/firewalls.png
     :width: 420

- Unhindered HTTP/HTTPS  web-access (no firewall on ports 80, 443);
  or access through HTTP Proxy;
- (optional) Excel, to view & edit simulation’s input and output files;
- (optional) GitHub account to submit and resolve issues.




*All-In-One* Installation under Windows
---------------------------------------
- Download **all-in-one archive** from https://github.com/JRCSTU/CO2MPAS-TA/releases/
  (it only runs on **64bit PCs**).

  .. Tip::
     Search in older releases if the latest does not contain an ALLINONE archive,
     and remember to upgrade |co2mpas| afterwords.


- Use the original `"7z" extractor <http://portableapps.com/apps/utilities/7-zip_portable>`_,
  since "plain-zip" application produces *out-of-memory* errors when expanding long
  directories.

  .. Note::
     Prefer to **extract it in a folder without any spaces in its path.**
  .. image:: _static/Co2mpasALLINONE-Extract.gif
     :scale: 75%
     :alt: Extract Co2mpas-ALLINONE into Desktop
     :align: center

- Run ``INSTALL.vbs`` script contained in the root of the unzipped folder.
  It will install links for commons |co2mpas| tasks under your *Windows*
  Start-Menu.

  .. image:: _static/Co2mpasALLINONE-InstallShortcuts.gif
     :scale: 75%
     :alt: Install Co2mpas-ALLINONE shortcupts into Window Start-menu.
     :align: center

- You can start |co2mpas| from *Windows start-menu* by pressing the `[WinKey]` and
  start typing `'co2mpas'`, or by selecting the |co2mpas| menu item from *All Programs*.

     :scale: 75%
     :alt: Launch |co2mpas| from Window Start-menu.
     :align: center

  Alternatively, advanced users may continue to use the Console.

.. Note::
   If you have downloaded an *all-in-one* from previous version of |co2mpas|
   you may upgrade |co2mpas| contained within.
   Follow the instructions in the "Upgrade" section, below.


Upgrade |co2mpas|
-----------------
Uninstall and re-install it from the |co2mpas| CONSOLE::

    pip uninstall co2mpas
    pip install co2mpas

.. Tip::

    Don't forget verify that the installed version is the correct one by checking
    the output of this command::

        co2mpas -vV

Upgrade |co2mpas| in a corporate environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. Note::
    This option has been retracted - please either download ALLINONE or
    just the *wheel* from https://pypi.org/project/co2mpas/ and install it,
    asuming that no other dependencies have changed.

Generic Tips
------------

- You may freely move & copy this folder around.
  But prefer NOT TO HAVE SPACES IN THE PATH LEADING TO IT.

- To view & edit textual files, such as ``.txt``, ``.bat`` or config-files
  starting with dot(``.``), you may use the "ancient" Window *notepad* editor,
  but it will save you from  a lot of trouble if you download and install
  **notepad++** from: http://portableapps.com/apps/development/notepadpp_portable
  (no admin-rights needed).

  Even better if you combine it with the "gem" file-manager of the '90s,
  **TotalCommander**, from http://www.ghisler.com/ (no admin-rights needed).
  From inside this file-manager, ``F3`` key-shortcut views files.

- The **Cygwin** POSIX-environment and its accompanying **bash-shell** are
  a much better choice to give console-commands compare to `cmd.exe` prompt,
  supporting *auto-completion* for various commands (with ``[TAB]`` key) and
  enhanced history search (with ``[UP]/[DOWN]`` cursor-keys).

  There are MANY tutorials and crash-courses for bash:

  - a concise one:
    http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Training/Tutorials/Reference/unixprimer.html
  - a more detailed guide (just ignore the Linux-specific part):
    http://linuxcommand.org/lc3_lts0020.php
  - a useful poster with all fundamental bash-commands (eg. `ls`, `pwd`, `cd`):
    http://www.improgrammer.net/linux-commands-cheat-sheet/

- The console automatically copies into clipboard anything that is selected
  with the mouse.  In case of errors, copy and paste the offending commands and
  their error-messages to emails sent to JRC.

- When a new |co2mpas| version comes out it is not necessary to download the full
  ALLINONE archive, but you choose instead to just *upgrade* co2mpas.

  Please follow the upgrade procedure in the main documentation.

Input template
--------------
The sub-commands ``batch`` (Run) and ``ta`` (Run TA) accept either a single
**input-excel-file** or a folder with multiple input-files for each vehicle.
You can download an *empty* input excel-file from the GUI:

.. image:: _static/Co2mpasALLINONE-Template.gif
   :scale: 75%
   :alt: Generate |co2mpas| input template
   :align: center

Or you can create an empty vehicle template-file (e.g., ``vehicle_1.xlsx``)
inside the *input-folder* with the ``template`` sub-command::

        $ co2mpas template input/vehicle_1.xlsx -f
        Creating TEMPLATE INPUT file 'input/vehicle_1.xlsx'...

The generated file contains descriptions to help you populate it with vehicle
data. For items where an array of values is required (e.g. gear-box ratios) you
may reference different parts of the spreadsheet following the syntax of the
`"xlref" mini-language <https://pandalone.readthedocs.org/en/latest/reference.html#module-pandalone.xleash>`_.

.. tip::
   For an explanation of the naming of the fields, read the :ref:`excel-model`
   section

Demo files
----------
The simulator contains demo-files that are a nice starting point to try out.
You can generate those *demo* vehicles from the GUI:

.. image:: _static/Co2mpasALLINONE-Demo.gif
   :scale: 75%
   :alt: Generate |co2mpas| demo files
   :align: center

Or you can create the demo files inside the *input-folder* with the ``demo``
sub-command::

    $ co2mpas demo input -f
    17:57:43       : INFO:co2mpas_main:Creating INPUT-DEMO file 't\co2mpas_demo-1.xlsx'...
    17:57:43       : INFO:co2mpas_main:Creating INPUT-DEMO file 't\co2mpas_simplan.xlsx'...
    17:57:43       : INFO:co2mpas_main:Run generated demo-files with command:
        co2mpas batch t

    You may find more demos inside `CO2MPAS/Demos` folder of your ALLINONE.

Synchronizing time-series
-------------------------
The model might fail in case your time-series signals are time-shifted and/or
with different sampling rates. Even if the run succeeds, the results will not
be accurate enough, because the data are not synchronized with the theoretical
cycle.

As an aid tool, you may use the ``datasync`` tool to "synchronize" and
"resample" your data, which have been acquired from different sources.

.. image:: _static/Co2mpasALLINONE-Datasync.gif
   :scale: 75%
   :alt: datasync tool
   :align: center

To get the syntax of the ``datasync`` console-command, open a console where
you have installed |co2mpas| and type::

    ## datasync help.
    $ datasync --help

    Shift and resample excel-tables; see http://co2mpas.io/usage.html#Synchronizing-time-series.

    Usage:
      datasync template [-f] [--cycle <cycle>] <excel-file-path>...
      datasync          [-v | -q | --logconf=<conf-file>] [--force | -f]
                        [--interp <method>] [--no-clone] [--prefix-cols]
                        [-O <output>] <x-label> <y-label> <ref-table>
                        [<sync-table> ...] [-i=<label=interp> ...]
      datasync          [-v | -q | --logconf=<conf-file>] (--version | -V)
      datasync          (--interp-methods | -l)
      datasync          --help

    Options:
      <x-label>              Column-name of the common x-axis (e.g. 'times') to be
                             re-sampled if needed.
      <y-label>              Column-name of y-axis cross-correlated between all
                             <sync-table> and <ref-table>.
      <ref-table>            The reference table, in *xl-ref* notation (usually
                             given as `file#sheet!`); synced columns will be
                             appended into this table.
                             The captured table must contain <x_label> & <y_label>
                             as column labels.
                             If hash(`#`) symbol missing, assumed as file-path and
                             the table is read from its 1st sheet .
      <sync-table>           Sheets to be synced in relation to <ref-table>, also in
                             *xl-ref* notation.
                             All tables must contain <x_label> & <y_label> as column
                             labels.
                             Each xlref may omit file or sheet-name parts; in that
                             case, those from the previous xlref(s) are reused.
                             If hash(`#`) symbol missing, assumed as sheet-name.
                             If none given, all non-empty sheets of <ref-table> are
                             synced against the 1st one.
      -O=<output>            Output folder or file path to write the results
                             [default: .]:

                             - Non-existent path: taken as the new file-path; fails
                               if intermediate folders do not exist, unless --force.
                             - Existent file: file-path to overwrite if --force,
                               fails otherwise.
                             - Existent folder: writes a new file
                               `<ref-file>.sync<.ext>` in that folder; --force
                               required if that file exists.

      -f, --force            Overwrite excel-file(s) and create any missing
                             intermediate folders.
      --prefix-cols          Prefix all synced column names with their source
                             sheet-names. By default, only clashing column-names are
                             prefixed.
      --no-clone             Do not clone excel-sheets contained in <ref-table>
                             workbook into output.
      --interp=<method>      Interpolation method used in the resampling for all
                             signals [default: linear]: 'linear', 'nearest', 'zero',

                             'polynomial', 'spline' is passed to
                             scipy.interpolate.interp1d. Both 'polynomial' and
                             'spline' require that you also specify an order (int),
                             e.g. df.interpolate(--interp=polynomial4).
                             'krogh', 'piecewise_polynomial', 'pchip' and 'akima'
                             are all wrappers around the scipy interpolation methods
                             of similar names.
                             'integral' is respect the signal integral.
      -i=<label=interp>      Interpolation method used in the resampling for a
                             signal with a specific label
                             (e.g., `-i alternator_currents=integral`).
      -l, --interp-methods   List of all interpolation methods that can be used in
                             the resampling.
      --cycle=<cycle>        If set (e.g., --cycle=nedc.manual), the <ref-table> is
                             populated with the theoretical velocity profile.
                             Options: 'nedc.manual', 'nedc.automatic',
                             'wltp.class1', 'wltp.class2', 'wltp.class3a', and
                             'wltp.class3b'.

    SUB-COMMANDS:
        template             Generate "empty" input-file for the `datasync` cmd as
                             <excel-file-path>.


    Examples::

        ## Read the full contents from all `wbook.xlsx` sheets as tables and
        ## sync their columns using the table from the 1st sheet as reference:
        datasync times velocities folder/Book.xlsx

        ## Sync `Sheet1` using `Sheet3` as reference:
        datasync times velocities wbook.xlsx#Sheet3!  Sheet1!

        ## The same as above but with integers used to index excel-sheets.
        ## NOTE that sheet-indices are zero based!
        datasync times velocities wbook.xlsx#2! 0

        ## Complex Xlr-ref example:
        ## Read the table in sheet2 of wbook-2 starting at D5 cell
        ## or more Down 'n Right if that was empty, till Down n Right,
        ## and sync this based on 1st sheet of wbook-1:
        datasync times velocities wbook-1.xlsx  wbook-2.xlsx#0!D5(DR):..(DR)

        ## Typical usage for CO2MPAS velocity time-series from Dyno and OBD
        ## (the ref sheet contains the theoretical velocity profile):
        datasync template --cycle wltp.class3b template.xlsx
        datasync -O ./output times velocities template.xlsx#ref! dyno obd -i alternator_currents=integral -i battery_currents=integral

Datasync input template
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The sub-command ``datasync`` accepts a single **input-excel-file**.
You can download an *empty* input excel-file from the GUI or you can use the
``template`` sub-command:

.. image:: _static/Co2mpasALLINONE-Datasync_Template.gif
   :scale: 75%
   :alt: datasync template
   :align: center

Or you can create an empty datasync template-file (e.g., ``datasync.xlsx``)
inside the *sync-folder* with the ``template`` sub-command::

    $ datasync template sync/datasync.xlsx --cycle wltp.class3b -f
    2016-11-14 17:14:00,919: INFO:__main__:Creating INPUT-TEMPLATE file 'sync/datasync.xlsx'...

All sheets must share 2 common columns ``times`` and ``velocities`` (for
datasync cmd are ``<x-label>`` and ``<y-label>``). These describe the reference
signal that is used to synchronize the data.

The ``ref`` sheet (``<ref-table>``) is considered to contain the "theoretical"
profile, while other sheets (``dyno`` and ``obd``, i.e. ``<sync-table>`` for
datasync cmd) contains the data to synchronize and resample.

Run datasync
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Fill the dyno and obd sheet with the raw data. Then, you can synchronize the
data, using the GUI as follows:

.. image:: _static/Co2mpasALLINONE-Datasync_Run.gif
   :scale: 75%
   :alt: datasync
   :align: center

Or you can synchronize the data with the ``datasync`` command::

    datasync times velocities template.xlsx#ref! dyno obd -i alternator_currents=integral -i battery_currents=integral

.. note::
   The synchronized signals are added to the reference sheet (e.g., ``ref``).

   - *synchronization* is based on the *fourier transform*;
   - *resampling* is performed with a specific interpolation method.

   All tables are read from excel-sheets using the `xl-ref syntax
   <https://pandalone.readthedocs.org/en/latest/reference.html#module-pandalone.xleash>`_.


Run batch
---------
The default sub-command (``batch``) accepts either a single **input-excel-file**
or a folder with multiple input-files for each vehicle, and generates a
**summary-excel-file** aggregating the major result-values from these vehicles,
and (optionally) multiple **output-excel-files** for each vehicle run.

To run all demo-files (note, it might take considerable time), you can use the
GUI as follows:

.. image:: _static/Co2mpasALLINONE-Batch_Run.gif
   :scale: 75%
   :alt: |co2mpas| batch
   :align: center

.. note:: the file ``co2mpas_simplan.xlsx`` has the ``flag.engineering_mode``
   set to ``True``, because it contains a "simulation-plan" with non declaration
   data.

Or you can run |co2mpas| with the ``batch`` sub-command::

   $ co2mpas batch input -O output
   2016-11-15 17:00:31,286: INFO:co2mpas_main:Processing ['../input'] --> '../output'...
     0%|          | 0/11 [00:00<?, ?it/s]: Processing ../input\co2mpas_demo-0.xlsx
   ...
   ...
   Done! [527.420557 sec]

.. Note::
  For demonstration purposes, some some of the actual models will fail;
  check the *summary file*.

Run Type-Approval (``ta``) command
----------------------------------
The Type Approval command simulates the NEDC fuel consumption and CO2 emission
of the given vehicle using just the required `declaration inputs
<https://github.com/JRCSTU/CO2MPAS-TA/wiki/TA_compulsory_inputs>`_ (marked as
compulsory inputs in input file version >= 2.2.5) and produces an NEDC
prediction. If |co2mpas| finds some extra input it will raise a warning and it
will not produce any result. The type approval command is the |co2mpas| running
mode that is fully aligned to the WLTP-NEDC correlation `Regulation
<http://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regcomitology/index.cfm?do=search.documentdeta
il&gYsYfQyLRa3DqHm8YKXObaxj0Is1LmebRoBfg8saKszVqHZGdIwy2rS97ztb5t8b>`_.


The sub-command ``ta`` accepts either a single **input-excel-file** or a folder
with multiple input-files for each vehicle, and generates a
**summary-excel-file** aggregating the major result-values from these vehicles,
and multiple **output-excel-files** for each vehicle run.

.. note::
   The user can insert just the input files and the output folder.

To run the type approval command you can use the GUI as follows:

.. image:: _static/Co2mpasALLINONE-TA_Run.gif
   :scale: 75%
   :alt: |co2mpas| ta
   :align: center

Or you can run |co2mpas| with the ``ta`` sub-command::

   $ co2mpas ta input -O output
   2016-11-15 17:00:31,286: INFO:co2mpas_main:Processing ['../input'] --> '../output'...
     0%|          | 0/1 [00:00<?, ?it/s]: Processing ../input\co2mpas_demo-0.xlsx
   ...
   ...
   Done! [51.6874 sec]

Output files
------------
The output-files produced on each run are the following:

- One file per vehicle, named as ``<timestamp>-<inp-fname>.xls``:
  This file contains all inputs and calculation results for each vehicle
  contained in the batch-run: scalar-parameters and time series for target,
  calibration and prediction phases, for all cycles.
  In addition, the file contains all the specific submodel-functions that
  generated the results, a comparison summary, and information on the python
  libraries installed on the system (for investigating reproducibility issues).

- A Summary-file named as ``<timestamp>-summary.xls``:
  Major |CO2| emissions values, optimized |CO2| parameters values and
  success/fail flags of |co2mpas| submodels for all vehicles in the batch-run.


Custom output xl-files as templates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You may have defined customized xl-files for summarizing time-series and
scalar parameters. To have |co2mpas| fill those "output-template" files with
its results, execute it with the ``-D flag.output_template=file/path.xlsx``
option.

To create/modify one output-template yourself, do the following:

1. Open a typical |co2mpas| output-file for some vehicle.

2. Add one or more sheets and specify/referring |co2mpas| result-data using
   `named-ranges <https://www.google.it/search?q=excel+named-ranges>`_.

   .. Warning::
      Do not use simple/absolute excel references (e.g. ``=B2``).
      Use excel functions (indirect, lookup, offset, etc.) and array-functions
      together with string references to the named ranges
      (e.g. ``=indirect("output.prediction.nedc_h.pa!_co2_emission_value")``).

3. (Optional) Delete the old sheets and save your file.

4. Use that file together with the ``-D flag.output_template=file/path.xlsx``
   argument.


Simulation plan
---------------
It is possible to launch |co2mpas| once, and have it run the model multiple
times, with variations on the input-data, all contained in a single
(or more) input file(s).

The data for **base model** are contained in the regular sheets, and any
variations are provided in additional sheets which names starting with
the ``plan.`` prefix.
These sheets must contain a table where each row is a single simulation,
while the columns names are the parameters that the user want to vary.
The columns of these tables can contain the following special names:

- **id**: Identifies the variation id.
- **base**: this is a file path of a |co2mpas| excel input, this model will be
  used as new base vehicle.
- **run_base**: this is a boolean. If true the base model results are computed
  and stored, otherwise the data are just loaded.

You can use the GUI as follows:

.. image:: _static/Co2mpasALLINONE-Plan_Run.gif
   :scale: 75%
   :alt: |co2mpas| batch simulation plan
   :align: center

.. note:: the file ``co2mpas_simplan.xlsx`` has the ``flag.engineering_mode``
   set to ``True``, because it contains a "simulation-plan" with non declaration
   data.

Or you can run |co2mpas| with the ``batch`` sub-command::

   $ co2mpas batch input/co2mpas_simplan.xlsx -O output
   2016-11-15 17:00:31,286: INFO:co2mpas_main:Processing ['../input/co2mpas_simplan.xlsx'] --> '../output'...
     0%|          | 0/4 [00:00<?, ?it/s]: Processing ../input\co2mpas_simplan.xlsx
   ...
   ...
   Done! [180.4692 sec]


Launch |co2mpas| from Jupyter(aka IPython)
------------------------------------------
You may enter the data for a single vehicle and run its simulation, plot its
results and experiment in your browser using `IPython <http://ipython.org/>`_.

The usage pattern is similar to "demos" but requires to have **ipython**
installed:

1. Ensure *ipython* with *notebook* "extra" is installed:

   .. Warning::
      This step requires too many libraries to provide as standalone files,
      so unless you have it already installed, you will need a proper
      *http-connectivity* to the standard python-repo.

   .. code-block:: console

        $ pip install ipython[notebook]
        Installing collected packages: ipython[notebook]
        ...
        Successfully installed ipython-x.x.x notebook-x.x.x


2. Then create the demo ipython-notebook(s) into some folder
   (i.e. assuming the same setup from above, ``tutorial/input``):

   .. code-block:: console

        $ pwd                     ## Check our current folder (``cd`` alone for Windows).
        .../tutorial

        $ co2mpas ipynb ./input

3. Start-up the server and open a browser page to run the vehicle-simulation:

   .. code-block:: console

        $ ipython notebook ./input

4. A new window should open to your default browser (AVOID IEXPLORER) listing
   the ``simVehicle.ipynb`` notebook (and all the demo xls-files).
   Click on the ``*.ipynb`` file to "load" the notebook in a new tab.

   The results are of a simulation run already pre-generated for this notebook
   but you may run it yourself again, by clicking the menu::

        "menu" --> `Cell` --> `Run All`

   And watch it as it re-calculates *cell* by cell.

5. You may edit the python code on the cells by selecting them and clicking
   ``Enter`` (the frame should become green), and then re-run them,
   with ``Ctrl + Enter``.

   Navigate your self around by taking the tutorial at::

        "menu" --> `Help` --> `User Interface Tour`

   And study the example code and diagrams.

6. When you have finished, return to the console and issue twice ``Ctrl + C``
   to shutdown the *ipython-server*.

.. _debug:

Debugging and investigating results
-----------------------------------

- Make sure that you have installed `graphviz`, and when running the simulation,
  append also the ``-D flag.plot_workflow=True`` option.

  .. code-block:: console

        $ co2mpas batch bad-file.xlsx -D flag.plot_workflow=True

  A browser tab will open at the end with the nodes processed.

- Use the ``modelgraph`` sub-command to plot the offending model (or just
  out of curiosity).  For instance:

  .. code-block:: console

        $ co2mpas modelgraph co2mpas.model.physical.wheels.wheels

  .. module:: co2mpas

  .. dispatcher:: d
     :alt: Flow-diagram Wheel-to-Engine speed ratio calculations.
     :height: 240
     :width: 320

     >>> import co2mpas
     >>> d = co2mpas.model.physical.wheels.wheels()

- Inspect the functions mentioned in the workflow and models and search them
  in `CO2MPAS documentation <http://co2mpas.io/>`_ ensuring you are
  visiting the documents for the actual version you are using.


.. _explanation:

Model
=====
Execution Model
---------------
The execution of |co2mpas| model for a single vehicle is a stepwise procedure
of 3 stages: ``precondition``, ``calibration``, and ``prediction``.
These are invoked repeatedly, and subsequently combined, for the various cycles,
as shown in the "active" flow-diagram of the execution, below:

.. module:: co2mpas

.. dispatcher:: dsp
   :opt: depth=-1
   :alt: Flow-diagram of the execution of various Stages and Cycles sub-models.
   :width: 640

   >>> import co2mpas
   >>> dsp = co2mpas.model.model()

.. Tip:: The models in the diagram are nested; explore by clicking on them.

1. **Precondition:** identifies the initial state of the vehicle by running
   a preconditioning *WLTP* cycle, before running the *WLTP-H* and *WLTP-L*
   cycles.
   The inputs are defined by the ``input.precondition.wltp_p`` node,
   while the outputs are stored in ``output.precondition.wltp_p``.

2. **Calibration:** the scope of the stage is to identify, calibrate and select
   (see next sections) the best physical models from the WLTP-H and WLTP-L
   inputs (``input.calibration.wltp_x``).
   If some of the inputs needed to calibrate the physical models are not
   provided (e.g. ``initial_state_of_charge``), the model will select the
   missing ones from precondition-stage's outputs
   (``output.precondition.wltp_p``).
   Note that all data provided in ``input.calibration.wltp_x`` overwrite those
   in ``output.precondition.wltp_p``.

3. **Prediction:** executed for the NEDC and as well as for the WLTP-H and
   WLTP-L cycles. All predictions use the ``calibrated_models``. The inputs to
   predict the cycles are defined by the user in ``input.prediction.xxx`` nodes.
   If some or all inputs for the prediction of WLTP-H and WLTP-L cycles are not
   provided, the model will select from ```output.calibration.wltp_x`` nodes a
   minimum set required to predict |CO2| emissions.

.. _excel-model:

Excel input: data naming conventions
------------------------------------
This section describes the data naming convention used in the |co2mpas| template
(``.xlsx`` file). In it, the names used as **sheet-names**, **parameter-names**
and **column-names** are "sensitive", in the sense that they construct a
*data-values tree* which is then fed into into the simulation model as input.
These names are split in "parts", as explained below with examples:

- **sheet-names** parts::

                  base.input.precondition.WLTP-H.ts
                  └┬─┘ └─┬─┘ └────┬─────┘ └─┬──┘ └┬┘
      scope────────┘     │        │         │     │
      usage──────────────┘        │         │     │
      stage───────────────────────┘         │     │
      cycle─────────────────────────────────┘     │
      sheet_type──────────────────────────────────┘


  First 4 parts above are optional, but at least one of them must be present on
  a **sheet-name**; those parts are then used as defaults for all
  **parameter-names** contained in that sheet. **type** is optional and specify
  the type of sheet.

- **parameter-names**/**columns-names** parts::

                     plan.target.prediction.initial_state_of_charge.WLTP-H
                     └┬─┘ └─┬─┘ └────┬────┘ └──────────┬──────────┘ └──┬─┘
      scope(optional)─┘     │        │                 │               │
      usage(optional)───────┘        │                 │               │
      stage(optional)────────────────┘                 │               │
      parameter────────────────────────────────────────┘               │
      cycle(optional)──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

  OR with the last 2 parts reversed::

                    plan.target.prediction.WLTP-H.initial_state_of_charge
                                           └──┬─┘ └──────────┬──────────┘
      cycle(optional)─────────────────────────┘              │
      parameter──────────────────────────────────────────────┘

.. note::
   - The dot(``.``) may be replaced by space.
   - The **usage** and **stage** parts may end with an ``s``, denoting plural,
     and are not case-insensitive, e.g. ``Inputs``.


Description of the name-parts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. **scope:**

   - ``base`` [default]: values provided by the user as input to |co2mpas|.
   - ``plan``: values selected (see previous section) to calibrate the models
     and to predict the |CO2| emission.
   - ``flag``: values provided by the user as input to ``run_base`` and
     ``run_plan`` models.

2. **usage:**

   - ``input`` [default]: values provided by the user as input to |co2mpas|.
   - ``data``: values selected (see previous section) to calibrate the models
     and to predict the |CO2| emission.
   - ``output``: |co2mpas| precondition, calibration, and prediction results.
   - ``target``: reference-values (**NOT USED IN CALIBRATION OR PREDICTION**) to
     be compared with the |co2mpas| results. This comparison is performed in the
     *report* sub-model by ``compare_outputs_vs_targets()`` function.
   - ``config``: values provided by the user that modify the ``model_selector``.

3. **stage:**

   - ``precondition`` [imposed when: ``wltp-p`` is specified as **cycle**]:
     data related to the precondition stage.
   - ``calibration`` [default]: data related to the calibration stage.
   - ``prediction`` [imposed when: ``nedc`` is specified as **cycle**]:
     data related to the prediction stage.
   - ``selector``: data related to the model selection stage.

4. **cycle:**

   - ``nedc-h``: data related to the *NEDC High* cycle.
   - ``nedc-l``: data related to the *NEDC Low* cycle.
   - ``wltp-h``: data related to the *WLTP High* cycle.
   - ``wltp-l``: data related to the *WLTP Low* cycle.
   - ``wltp-precon``: data related to the preconditioning *WLTP* cycle.
   - ``wltp-p``: is a shortcut of ``wltp-precon``.
   - ``nedc`` [default]: is a shortcut to set values for both ``nedc-h`` and
     ``nedc-l`` cycles.
   - ``wltp`` [default]: is a shortcut to set values for both ``wltp-h`` and
     ``wltp-l`` cycles.
   - ``all``: is a shortcut to set values for ``nedc``, ``wltp``,
     and ``wltp-p`` cycles.

5. **param:** any data node name (e.g. ``vehicle_mass``) used in the physical
   model.

6. **sheet_type:** there are three sheet types, which are parsed according to
   their contained data:

   - **pl** [parsed range is ``#A1:__``]: table of scalar and time-depended
     values used into the simulation plan as variation from the base model.
   - **pa** [parsed range is ``#B2:C_``]: scalar or not time-depended
     values (e.g. ``r_dynamic``, ``gear_box_ratios``, ``full_load_speeds``).
   - **ts** [parsed range is ``#A2:__``]: time-depended values (e.g.
     ``times``, ``velocities``, ``gears``). Columns without values are skipped.
     **COLUMNS MUST HAVE THE SAME LENGTH!**

   ..note:: If it is not defined, the default value follows these rules:
     When **scope** is ``plan``, the sheet is parsed as **pl**.
     If **scope** is ``base`` and **cycle** is missing in the **sheet-name**,
     the sheet is parsed as **pa**, otherwise it is parsed as **ts**.

Calibrated Physical Models
--------------------------
There are potentially eight models calibrated from input scalar-values and
time-series (see :doc:`reference`):

1. *AT_model*,
2. *electric_model*,
3. *clutch_torque_converter_model*,
4. *co2_params*,
5. *engine_cold_start_speed_model*,
6. *engine_coolant_temperature_model*,
7. *engine_speed_model*, and
8. *start_stop_model*.

Each model is calibrated separately over *WLTP_H* and *WLTP_L*.
A model can contain one or several functions predicting different quantities.
For example, the electric_model contains the following functions/data:

- *alternator_current_model*,
- *alternator_status_model*,
- *electric_load*,
- *max_battery_charging_current*,
- *start_demand*.

These functions/data are calibrated/estimated based on the provided input
(in the particular case: *alternator current*, *battery current*, and
*initial SOC*) over both cycles, assuming that data for both WLTP_H and WLTP_L
are provided.

.. Note::
    The ``co2_params`` model has a third possible calibration configuration
    (so called `ALL`) using data from both WLTP_H and WLTP_L combined
    (when both are present).


Model selection
---------------

.. Note::
   Since *v1.4.1-Rally*, this part of the model remains disabled,
   unless the ``flag.use_selector`` is true.

For the type approval mode the selection is fixed. The criteria is to select the
models calibrated from *WLTP_H* to predict *WLTP_H* and *NEDC_H*; and
from *WLTP_L* to predict *WLTP_L* and *NEDC_L*.

While for the engineering mode the automatic selection can be enabled adding
`-D flag.use_selector=True` to the batch command.
Then to select which is the best calibration
(from *WLTP_H* or *WLTP_L* or *ALL*) to be used in the prediction phase, the
results of each stage are compared against the provided input data (used in the
calibration).
The calibrated models are THEN used to recalculate (predict) the inputs of the
*WLTP_H* and *WLTP_L* cycles. A **score** (weighted average of all computed
metrics) is attributed to each calibration of each model as a result of this
comparison.

.. Note::
    The overall score attributed to a specific calibration of a model is
    the average score achieved when compared against each one of the input
    cycles (*WLTP_H* and *WLTP_L*).

    For example, the score of `electric_model` calibrated based on *WLTP_H*
    when predicting *WLTP_H* is 20, and when predicting *WLTP_L* is 14.
    In this case the overall score of the the `electric_model` calibrated
    based on *WLTP_H* is 17. Assuming that the calibration of the same model
    over *WLTP_L* was 18 and 12 respectively, this would give an overall score
    of 15.

    In this case the second calibration (*WLTP_L*) would be chosen for
    predicting the NEDC.

In addition to the above, a success flag is defined according to
upper or lower limits of scores which have been defined empirically by the JRC.
If a model fails these limits, priority is then given to a model that succeeds,
even if it has achieved a worse score.

The following table describes the scores, targets, and metrics for each model:

Developers Installation
=======================

Python Installation
-------------------
If you already have a suitable python-3 installation with all scientific
packages updated to their latest versions, you may skip this 1st stage.

.. Note::
    **Installing Python under Windows:**

    The program requires CPython-3, and depends on *numpy*, *scipy*, *pandas*,
    *sklearn* and *matplotlib* packages, which depend on C-native backends
    and need a C-compiler to install from sources.

    In *Windows* it is strongly suggested **NOT to install the standard CPython
    distribution that comes up first(!) when you google for "python windows"**,
    unless you are an experienced python-developer, and you know how to
    hunt down pre-compiled dependencies from the *PyPi* repository and/or
    from the `Unofficial Windows Binaries for Python Extension Packages
    <http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/>`_.

    Therefore we suggest that you download one of the following two
    *scientific-python* distributions:

      #. `WinPython <https://winpython.github.io/>`_ **python-3** (64 bit)
      #. `Anaconda <http://continuum.io/downloads>`_ **python-3** (64 bit)



Install WinPython
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The |winpython|_ distribution is just a collection of the standard pre-compiled
binaries for *Windows* containing all the scientific packages, and much more.
It is not update-able, and has a quasi-regular release-cycle of 3 months.


1. Install the latest **python-3.4+  64 bit** from https://winpython.github.io/.
   Prefer an **installation-folder without any spaces leading to it**.

2. Open the WinPython's command-prompt console, by locating the folder where
   you just installed it and run (double-click) the following file::

        <winpython-folder>\"WinPython Command Prompt.exe"


3. In the console-window check that you have the correct version of
   WinPython installed, and expect a similar response:

   .. code-block:: console

        > python -V
        Python 3.4.3

        REM Check your python is indeed where you installed it.
        > where python
        ....


4. Use this console and follow :ref:`install-co2mpas-package` instructions, below.



Install Anaconda
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The |anaconda|_ distribution is a non-standard Python environment that
for *Windows* containing all the scientific packages we need, and much more.
It is not update-able, and has a semi-regular release-cycle of 3 months.

1. Install Anaconda **python-3.4+ 64 bit** from http://continuum.io/downloads.
   Prefer an **installation-folder without any spaces leading to it**.

   .. Note::
        When asked by the installation wizard, ensure that *Anaconda* gets to be
        registered as the default python-environment for the user's account.

2. Open a *Windows* command-prompt console::

        "windows start button" --> `cmd.exe`

3. In the console-window check that you have the correct version of
   Anaconda-python installed, by typing:

   .. code-block:: console

        > python -V
        Python 3.4.3 :: Anaconda 2.3.0 (64-bit)

        REM Check your python is indeed where you installed it.
        > where python
        ....

4. Use this console and follow :ref:`install-co2mpas-package` instructions, below.


.. _install-co2mpas-package:

Install |co2mpas| package
-------------------------
1. Install |co2mpas| executable internally into your python-environment with
   the following console-commands (there is no prob if the 1st `uninstall`
   command fails):

   .. code-block:: console

        > pip uninstall co2mpas
        > pip install co2mpas
        Collecting co2mpas
        Downloading http://pypi.co2mpas.io/packages/co2mpas-...
        ...
        Installing collected packages: co2mpas
        Successfully installed co2mpas-1.6.2.b1

   .. Warning::
        **Installation failures:**

        The previous step require http-connectivity for ``pip`` command to
        Python's "standard" repository (https://pypi.python.org/).
        In case you are behind a **corporate proxy**, you may try one of the methods
        described in section `Alternative installation methods`_, below.

        If all methods to install |co2mpas| fail, re-run ``pip`` command adding
        extra *verbose* flags ``-vv``, copy-paste the console-output, and report it
        to JRC.

2. Check that when you run |co2mpas|, the version executed is indeed the one
   installed above (check both version-identifiers and paths):

   .. code-block:: console

       > co2mpas -vV
       co2mpas_version: 1.6.2.b1
       co2mpas_rel_date: 2017-07-24 10:52:13
       co2mpas_path: d:\co2mpas_ALLINONE-64bit-v1.4.1\Apps\WinPython\python-3.4.3\lib\site-packages\co2mpas
       python_path: D:\co2mpas_ALLINONE-64bit-v1.4.1\WinPython\python-3.4.3
       python_version: 3.4.3 (v3.4.3:9b73f1c3e601, Feb 24 2015, 22:44:40) [MSC v.1600 XXX]
       PATH: D:\co2mpas_ALLINONE-64bit-v1.4.1\WinPython...


   .. Note::
       The above procedure installs the *latest* |co2mpas|, which
       **might be more up-to-date than the version described here!**

       In that case you can either:

       a) Visit the documents for the newer version actually installed.
       b) "Pin" the exact version you wish to install with a ``pip`` command
          (see section below).


Install extras
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Internally |co2mpas| uses an algorithmic scheduler to execute model functions.
In order to visualize the *design-time models* and *run-time workflows*
you need to install the **Graphviz** visualization library  from:
http://www.graphviz.org/.

If you skip this step, the ``modelgraph`` sub-command and the ``--plot-workflow``
option would both fail to run (see :ref:`debug`).



Upgrade |co2mpas| (with internet connectivity)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. Uninstall (see below) and re-install it.


Uninstall |co2mpas|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To uninstall |co2mpas| type the following command, and confirm it with ``y``:

.. code-block:: console

    > pip uninstall co2mpas
    Uninstalling co2mpas-<installed-version>
    ...
    Proceed (y/n)?


Re-run the command *again*, to make sure that no dangling installations are left
over; disregard any errors this time.


Alternative installation methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You may get multiple versions of |co2mpas|, from various places, but all
require the use of ``pip`` command from a *console* to install:

..  Tip::
    In all cases below, remember to uninstall |co2mpas| if it's already installed.

    Remember also to store the installation logs with the ``-v --log`` options,
    particularly if you install a specific version from GitHub

- **Latest STABLE:**
  use the default ``pip`` described command above.

- **Latest PRE-RELEASE:**
  append the ``--pre`` option in the ``pip`` command.

- **Specific version:**
  modify the ``pip`` command like that, with optionally appending ``--pre``:

  .. code-block:: console

      pip install co2mpas==1.0.1 --process-dependency-links ... # Other options, like above.

- **Specific branch** from the GitHub-sources:

  .. code-block:: console

      pip install -v log pip.log git+https://github.com/JRCSTU/co2mpas.git@dev --process-dependency-links

- **Specific commit** from the GitHub-sources:

  .. code-block:: console

      pip install -v log pip.log git+https://github.com/JRCSTU/co2mpas.git@2927346f4c513a --process-dependency-links

- **Speed-up download**:
  append  the ``--use-mirrors`` option in the ``pip`` command.

- (for all of the above) When you are **behind an http-proxy**:
  append an appropriately adapted option
  ``--proxy http://user:password@yourProxyUrl:yourProxyPort``.

  .. Important::
      To avert any security deliberations for this http-proxy "tunnel",
      JRC *cryptographically signs* all *final releases* with one of those
      keys:
      - ``GPG key ID: 9CF277C40A8A1B08`` form @ankostis
      - ``GPG key ID: 1831F9C2294A33CC`` for @vinci1it2000

      Your IT staff may `validate their authenticity
      <https://www.davidfischer.name/2012/05/signing-and-verifying-python-packages-with-pgp/>`_
      and detect *man-in-the-middle* attacks, however impossible.

- (for all of the above) **Without internet connectivity** or when the above
  proxy cmd fails:

  1. Use an existing *Python-3.5* environment; that might be an older *ALLINONE*,
     |winpython|_, |anaconda|_ or Linux's standard python environment.

  2. With with a "regular" browser and when connected to the Internet,
     pre-download locally and unzip the respective ``co2mpas_DEPENDENCIES-vX.X.XXX.7z`` file
     from the latest ALLINONE release (e.g. http://github.com/JRCSTU/CO2MPAS-TA/releases/).
     This archive contains all the dependent packages of |co2mpas|.

  3. Install |co2mpas|, referencing the above folder.
     Assuming that you unzipped the packages in the folder ``path/to/co2mpas_packages``,
     use a console-command like this:

     .. code-block:: console

        pip install co2mpas  --no-index  -f path/to/co2mpas_packages --process-dependency-links


Install Multiple versions in parallel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In order to run and compare results from different |co2mpas| versions,
you may use `virtualenv <http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/>`_
command.

The `virtualenv` command creates isolated python-environments ("children-venvs")
where in each one you can install a different versions of |co2mpas|.

.. Note::
    The `virtualenv` command does NOT run under the "conda" python-environment.
    Use the `conda command <http://conda.pydata.org/docs/using/envs.html>`_
    in similar manner to create child *conda-environments* instead.


1. Ensure `virtualenv` command installed in your "parent" python-environment,
   i.e the "WinPython" you use:

   .. code-block:: console

       > pip install virtualenv

   .. Note::
      The ``pip`` command above has to run only once for each parent python-env.
      If `virtualenv` is already installed, ``pip`` will exit gracefully.



2. Ensure |co2mpas| uninstalled in your parent-env:

   .. code-block:: console

       > pip uninstall co2mpas

   .. Warning::
     It is important for the "parent" python-env NOT to have |co2mpas| installed!
     The reason is that you must set "children venvs" to inherit all packages
     installed on their "parent" (i.e. `numpy` and `pandas`), and you cannot
     update any inherited package from within a child-env.


3. Move to the folder where you want your "venvs" to reside and create
   the "venv" with this command:

   .. code-block:: console

       > virtualenv --system-site-packages co2mpas_v1.0.1.venv

   The ``--system-site-packages`` option instructs the child-venv to inherit
   all "parent" packages (numpy, pandas).

   Select a venv's  name to signify the version it will contains,
   e.g. ``co2mpas_v1.0.1.venv``.  The ``.venv`` at the end is not required,
   it is just for tagging the *venv* folders.

4. "Activate" the new "venv" by running the following command
   (notice the dot(``.``) at the begining of the command):

   .. code-block:: console

        > .\co2mpas_v1.0.1.venv\Scripts\activate.bat

   Or type this in *bash*:

   .. code-block:: console

        $ source co2mpas_v1.0.1.venv\Scripts\activate.bat

   You must now see that your prompt has been prefixed with the venv's name.


6. Install the |co2mpas| version you want inside the activated venv.
   See the :ref:`install-co2mpas-package` section, above.

   .. Tip::
      Always store the installation logs, particularly if you install a specific version
      from GitHub::

          pip install -v log pip.log ...  ## co2mpas specifiers follows here...

      Don't forget afterwards to check that what you get when running |co2mpas| is what you
      installed.

7. To "deactivate" the active venv, type:

   .. code-block:: console

       > deactivate

   The prompt-prefix with the venv-name should now dissappear.  And if you
   try to invoke |co2mpas|, it should fail.



.. Tip::
    - Repeat steps 2-->5 to create venvs for different versions of co2mpas.
    - Use steps (6: Activate) and (9: Deactivate) to switch between different
      venvs.


Autocompletion
--------------
In order to press ``[Tab]`` and get completions, do the following in your
environment (ALLINONE is pre-configured with them):

- For the |clink|_ environment, on `cmd.exe`, add the following *lua* script
  inside clink's profile folder: ``clink/profile/co2mpas_autocompletion.lua``

  .. code-block:: lua

    --[[ clink-autocompletion for CO2MPAS
    --]]
    local handle = io.popen('co2mpas-autocompletions')
    words_str = handle:read("*a")
    handle:close()

    function words_generator(prefix, first, last)
        local cmd = 'co2mpas'
        local prefix_len = #prefix

        --print('P:'..prefix..', F:'..first..', L:'..last..', l:'..rl_state.line_buffer)
        if prefix_len == 0 or rl_state.line_buffer:sub(1, cmd:len()) ~= cmd then
            return false
        end

        for w in string.gmatch(words_str, "%S+") do
            -- Add matching app-words.
            --
            if w:sub(1, prefix_len) == prefix then
                clink.add_match(w)
            end

            -- Add matching files & dirs.
            --
            full_path = true
            nf = clink.match_files(prefix..'*', full_path)
            if nf > 0 then
                clink.matches_are_files()
            end
        end
        return clink.match_count() > 0
    end

    sort_id = 100
    clink.register_match_generator(words_generator)


- For the *bash* shell just add this command in your :file:`~/.bashrc`
  (or type it every time you open a new console):

  .. code-block:: console

      complete -fdev -W "`co2mpas-autocompletions`" co2mpas
